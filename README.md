# Ben Limpich's Take Home Project

## How to run locally

### Server

1. `cd server`
2. `npm install`
3. `node server`

### Client

1. `cd client`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start`

Note: if it asks you to run it on a port other than 3000 say yes, that's fine.

## TODO:

- Add unit testing so that future modifications know if they break any existing functionality
- Add error UI in the case that the request to the server fails
- Add accessibility labels to the components so that they're usable by people with screen readers
